Yo yo yo!

Watch this fact dump cuz it's not finished

Research & Data Collection: Jun 26 - Jun 30
Facts about E. Coli
Rod-shaped, gram negative bacteria(meaning it doesn’t have much peptidoglycan in its cell wall)
The length of an E. Coli bacterium is 2 um on average, while the diameter is about 0.25 - 1 um
Facultative anaerobe(it uses oxygen but can survive without it)
Most widely studied prokaryote; since it takes only 20 mins to reproduce, it is useful with DNA recombination
E. Coli enters a baby usually within the first 40 hours of birth
Most strains of E. Coli provide benefits to the host by producing the vitamin K2 and protecting the intestine from pathogenic bacteria
E. Coli is also very  diverse and can have various mutations in a short period of time
How structure affects function
Relatively simple DNA & ability to transfer plasmids means that E. Coli can multiply and evolve quickly, creating virulent strains
Function
Most strains are harmless and make up the normal microbiome of the lower intestine of warm-blooded animals
Has a mutualistic relationship with the body, since it produces vitamin K2(aids in blood clotting) and crowds out harmful bacteria
Some variants(serotypes) can cause gastroenteritis, urinary tract infection, etc
One form of transmission is the fecal-oral route: contaminated feces —> food/fingers(if hands are not washed) —> mouth
Many strains have developed antibiotic resistance to common drugs, and are able to transfer this resistance to other bacteria
Dangers of Contamination
Undercooked Ground Meat can lead to foodborne disease from E. Coli
Although most E. Coli strains are harmless, some strains like the Shiga toxin - producing E. Coli (STEC) are very dangerous to humans
This disease may be potentially fatal to younger children and the elderly
Since the Shiga toxin - producing E. Coli is heat sensitive, the most effective way of eliminating the threat of foodborne disease is to thoroughly cook the meat
The optimal temperature for growth of the STEC strain would be 37 degrees celsius and it can even grow in a pH of 4.4, so eliminate the bacteria would be to heat the food at least at a temperature of 70 degrees celsius or higher
The symptoms of the STEC strain may include diarrhea and cramps along with a fever that may induce vomiting
Patients will usually recover in about 10 days with an incubation period ranging from 3 - 8 days
In a worst case scenario, the bacteria can lead to the patient developing haemolytic uraemic syndrome(HUS), which can cause a multitude of neurological problems and potentially even death.
Infection outbreaks / Research history
E. Coli vs. Others
Very few people with an infection actually die, but some complications increase the mortality rate
HUS: 3-5% mortality
Neonatal meningitis: 8% mortality
Pathogenic vs. Good E. Coli
Most strains are harmless and even provide benefits to the host(Has a mutualistic relationship with the body, since it produces vitamin K2, which aids in blood clotting), but there are a few virulent strains that can spread through contaminated food
Outbreaks
Largest known outbreak - Sept 1999, 781 people infected (HUS in <20), 2 deaths, probable cause: contaminated drinking water
Most common source = ground beef
Aug 1999 - Clark County, WA outbreak - 37 infected from lake water
1996 outbreak - Odwalla Apple Juice didn’t pasteurize its juice - 66 infected, 1 ropped
Oct 2015 - Chipotle - most recent famous one - 55 infected
Sept 2006 - Dole Baby Spinach - 205 infected, 3 rops across 26 states
Other food-poisoning type pathogens
Salmonella
Mar/Apr 1985 - 6,149 cases reported in Illinois from Blue Brook 2% milk
1965 - approx 16,000 people infected near Riverside, CA form
2015 - Andrew & WIlliamson cucumbers computers - 907 infected, 6 rops
Staphylococcus aureus


Norovirus


Clostridium perfringens
Listeria
Known for being mean to pregnant women
2011 - Holly, Colorado, cantaloupes - 147 infected, 33 rops

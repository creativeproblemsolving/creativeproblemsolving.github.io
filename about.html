<h1>About</h1>

<h2>Pre-Covid</h2>
<p>
  Pre-Covid, our club hosted weekly math/science discussions in which we collaborated to solve some interesting problems in creative ways at CHS. But when Covid hit, we wanted to do something more for the community to help out in the difficult time. We realized young students might not be getting challenged as much, so we collaborated with GT students of a local elementary school in our area (Valley Ranch Elementary); we made short video clips introducing different academic concepts, brain-teaser questions to show how problem-solving can be fun, and personal videos about growth and school.

  We also realized that kids around the world had the same problem and needed a creative outlet, so we created a youtube channel in which the student community around the world can post videos diving into different topics that interest them (e.g. probability/stats, natural sciences, music, computer science, interesting problems/riddles, patterns in math, and just random phenomena that interest us).
</p>

<h2>Now</h2>
<p>
  With the youtube channel, we have been able to create a community, which currently consists of an international school (DAV Thermal in Haryana, India), a group of juniors at CHS, and some other individual collaborators in the local area, and we are currently reaching out to other schools and individuals. It is my sincere hope that this will one day become a large peer-to-peer collaborative learning platform.
</p>
<p>
  With these collaborations, we would like for the students in each group to explore the videos we have already put out on the youtube channel. We would encourage the students to create and share interesting videos (broadly defined) on the youtube channel. These videos can be about any math, science, music, problem-solving, or any miscellaneous concepts the students find interesting. In the spirit of collaboration, we would also encourage the students to leave comments in othersâ€™ videos if they have any thoughts or questions about the topic.

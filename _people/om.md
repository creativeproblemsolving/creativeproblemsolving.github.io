Hello! My name is Om, and I am the founder and president of the Creative Problem Solving Club. I oversee our learning community, and guide the club to our purpose - to make a better peer-to-peer collaborative and creative learning community. In my free time, I play percussion, exercise, code, and challenge myself to puzzles and riddles.
